#Transfering Ark to Ethereum

Transferring Ark to Ethereum is easy. In the ACES UI, you may click the Ethereum Transfer tab to pull up the transfer form. On this form you will need to provide three fields, 1) the "Return Ark Address" which is the address you'd like to receive excess ark back, if you happen to send too much. 2) The "Recipient Eth Address" which is the ethereum address you'd like to transfer the ark value to. 3) "Eth Amount" which is the amount of ether you'd like to send to the address. The listener will compute how much equivalent ark you must send to the listener based on this value.
