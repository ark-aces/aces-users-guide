# Transfering Ark to Ethereum

Transferring Ark to Ethereum is easy. In the ACES UI, you may click the Ethereum Transfer tab to pull up the transfer form. On this form you will need to provide three fields, 1) the "Return Ark Address" which is the address you'd like to receive excess ark back, if you happen to send too much. 2) The "Recipient Eth Address" which is the ethereum address you'd like to transfer the ark value to. 3) "Eth Amount" which is the amount of ether you'd like to send to the address. The listener will compute how much equivalent ark you must send to the listener based on this value.

Once you submit the form you will be taken to the listener status page. Initially you will see this page in yellow with the message that it is on and listening to the Ark blockchain. In the red box you'll see the details of the transaction that ACES is listening for. You must send the required ark amount to the Service Ark Address listed and include the SmartBridge Text provided to you.

Go to your preferred method of Ark transaction. In this example we will use the standard Ark Desktop Wallet. Submit the transaction as required by the listener.

Once submitted and confirmed once, the listener will turn green to show it was a success.

You can now confirm that the transfer was a success on the Ethereum blockchain by clicking the "Eth Transaction Hash".
